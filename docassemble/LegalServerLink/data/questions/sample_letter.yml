  use catchall: True
  temporary session: true
comment:
  Catchall features are enabled here just to check if you end up using a variable
  in your template that is not defined by the data stash transfer from LegalServer.

  This way, the question will not result in an error, but a basic Catch All question
  for that missing variable.

  This is a sample code block that will set all sorts of defaults for this letter package.
